KEYWORDS: CodeMeltedDEV, raspberry-pi, modules, cross-platform, gps, html-css-javascript, flutter-apps, pwsh, js-module, flutter-library, deno-module, pwsh-scripts, pwsh-module, c-library, cpp-lib
DESCRIPTION: The `codemelted.cpp` is a C++20 module that serves as a swiss army knife of the CodeMelted DEV modules. It has two primary compilation targets. The first is WASM providing the necessary JS and C++ bindings to support Single Page Application (SPA) development in either pure JS or using C++ and compiling the page. The second is as a C++20 module imported into a developer's C++ native application. The public namespaced interface will provide native implementations of the CodeMelted DEV module use cases where appropriate. The final compilation target is as a static library for usage primarily by the `codemelted.ps1` module.

## Versioning

The versioning of the module will be captured via GitHub or the modules documentation method. It will utilize semantic versioning `X.Y.Z` with the following rules for the numbering scheme this project.

- **X:** Completion of a given set of use cases (i.e. Async IO, Data, NPU, SDK, or User Interface).
- **Y:** Use case implemented, documented, tested, and ready for usage by a developer.
- **Z:** Bug fix or expansion of a use case.

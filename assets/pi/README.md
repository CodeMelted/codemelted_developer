DESCRIPTION: The CodeMelted DEV Pi Project will focus on developing native services to setup the ability to capture photography. This will come in two forms. The first is the ability to build a vehicle infotainment system with the ability to capture live photos / video while taking road trips. The second is as a dedicated photography station able to capture live video of the sky. All captured media will then have the ability to be archived to the codemelted.com network for later viewing via the CodeMelted PWA.

The origins of this idea stem from a project I worked on for a planned trip up to Purdue Bay, Alaska. To take such a trip would require being able to take photography during the drive or I would never make it back to the states if I stopped at every photography opportunity. The MVP prototype is as follows.

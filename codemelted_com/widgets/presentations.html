      From the <i>Bringing an Idea to an MVP</i> slide presentation implemented before COVID, I built a
      MVP prototype of a Raspberry Pi touch screen system for my 2006 Jeep Wrangler. The goal was to eventually
      one day go travel to Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. Well I have a newer Jeep and the technology has gotten faster.
      This is the upgrade and evolution of this initial idea. This is Raspberry Pi build out. Further slides will
      follow for each of the steps of the build.

      Before COVID I had a plan with my 2005 Jeep TJ to make a trip to Prudhoe Bay, Alaska.
      Unfortunately we all know what happened with that. But the idea spurned a fun project I did for work
      that is carrying over into a new design with a hopeful new trip in 2023 or 2024 time frame.

      In every software engineering career you will encounter a job that leaves a lasting
      impression because things went well or you had good teammates. You will also encounter
      jobs where nothing goes right, the manager is a pain, and nobody on the team pulls their wait.
      Then there is the mythical unicorn. A beast that does not exist in software engineering but
      I got to experience one time. Where the project was delivered ahead of time, hit all
      quality metrics established by the contract, and under budget. You never get all three.
      You typically on a good project will get two out of the three. The presentation below is
      a presentation I gave at one of my jobs documenting this unicorn and the things I believed
      were the reason for this encounter.  Enjoy.

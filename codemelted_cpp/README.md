<h1><img style="height: 35px;" src="header.png" /> CodeMelted - C/C++ Module</h1>

Welcome to the **CodeMelted - C/C++ Module** project. This project aims to implement the use cases from the **CodeMelted - Developer** project allowing for a need of speed for in application. It will be developed with a C header interface and a C++ implementation. This allows for the easiest integration into other modules via a Foreign Function Interface (FFI). It will also support web assembly for usage in the web browser. Last but not least, you can use it as its own compilable target for embedded / desktop / server implementations.

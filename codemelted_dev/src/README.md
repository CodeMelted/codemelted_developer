*BY: Mark Shaffer / LAST UPDATED: 2025-Jun-04*

"Write once, run anywhere (WORA)" was the famous slogan made by Sun Microsystems in 1995. At the time, this technology allowed for easy full stack engineering allowing you to target dedicated workstations and on-premises servers. So long as a Java Runtime Environment existed, you could run your code. Java was unable to keep to their slogan as web browsers became more advanced, mobile devices became ubiquitous, and companies no longer required dedicated servers.

As a full stack software engineer, I have had the privilege to work on technologies ranging from mainframes, custom built hardware from the 1980s, communications with satellites in space to data communication over Wide Area Networks. C, C++, and Java were the main drivers for this experience to include some FORTRAN and IBM Assembly 370. Also had the privilege to work on embedded systems utilizing different real-time operating systems as part of this wider communication systems experience.

Then came the secondary part of my career entering the commercial world. My full stack experience needed to evolve as Java was no longer enough. Instead of dedicated backend servers, there are now cloud services and the web made the ultimate runtime environment for reaching customers. As long as a device has a browser, the user can reach your app. While professionally my work has been in mobile app development, the technologies I learned along the way has led to learning other technologies for fulfilling my passion to deliver the greatest reach to customers for software engineers.

Enter the CodeMelted DEV project. The aim of this project is to deliver usable modules to aid software engineers for building full stack solutions for their applications. It will also serve as a learning tool providing a Rosetta stone between different programming languages. The Rosetta stone translation will serve a language specific implementations of the 13 chosen use cases (page 2) that all software engineers should be familiar.

- **<u>2025-Jun-04 (M. Shaffer)</u>:** Removed individual sections for each of the use cases. Updated sectioning. The section needing filling in really is the mathematical formulas. Also added reference section for each of the module SDK documentation.
- **<u>2025-May-31 (M. Shaffer)</u>:** Initial release of the document breaking down the use cases to serve as the Rosetta Stone between different programming languages.

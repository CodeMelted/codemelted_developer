DESCRIPTION: IoT provides low level device implementation of app / services where the need for speed is critical. This project will implement C-style C++. This means the header will be purely C allowing for easy integration into other project while implementing a C++ implementation that utilizes the minimum set of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). This gives the developer several options with this. They can build their own app / service, compile a library for integration into another language, or as Web Assembly for supporting Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).

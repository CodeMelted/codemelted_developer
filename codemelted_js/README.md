DESCRIPTION: Welcome to the CodeMelted - JS Module project. This project aims to give a common fullstack solution for Progressive Web Applications (PWA) utilizing the CodeMelted - Developer use cases. It utilizes the Deno Runtime to run as your backend service. This was chosen as it has a full range of services for your backend if you choose to utilize it. You can also take your backend and host it on a different platform. This allows you to not be locked into a vendor for your backend. It was also chosen because it implements the Browser Web APIs. This allows the module to implement backend and web frontend common code developing a more complete solution. Lastly, Deno provides the use of TypeScript natively out of the box. So you are able to utilize both JavaScript / TypeScript for your solution and roll with any build system.

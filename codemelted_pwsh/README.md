DESCRIPTION: The codemelted.ps1 script will provide a Command Line Interface (CLI) to facilitate common developer use cases on Mac, Linux, or Windows systems. When installed, the CLI will provide the codemelted command that can be accessed in a pwsh terminal or in ps1 scripts that facilitate a set of automated tasks. A developer may also build a Terminal User Interface (TUI) for a text-based user interface. Lastly it will facilitate in developing applications utilizing the CodeMelted DEV | Modules.

# GETTING STARTED

## Install pwsh Core

The following section walk you through the installation of the pwsh terminal. Once installed you can access the terminal via the `pwsh` command.

### Mac OS

From a Mac OS terminal execute the command:

```
brew install --cask powershell
```

### Linux OS

Follow the <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-linux">Install Powershell on Linux</a> to properly setup the pwsh terminal for your Linux flavor.

### Windows

From a windows cmd terminal execute the command

```
winget install --id Microsoft.PowerShell --source winget
```

### Raspberry Pi

The following series of commands will setup a pwsh terminal on a Raspberry Pi picking up the necessary repo and setting up the environment. Notice the `VERSION` as the currently identified version. Change this to install the latest version.

```sh
VERSION=7.5.0
sudo dpkg --add-architecture arm64
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libc6:arm64 libstdc++6:arm64
sudo mkdir -p /opt/microsoft/powershell/7
sudo wget -O /tmp/powershell.tar.gz https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/download/v${VERSION}/powershell-$VERSION}-linux-arm64.tar.gz
sudo tar zxf /tmp/powershell.tar.gz -C /opt/microsoft/powershell/7
sudo chmod +x /opt/microsoft/powershell/7/pwsh
sudo ln -s /opt/microsoft/powershell/7/pwsh /usr/bin/pwsh
sudo rm /tmp/powershell.tar.gz
pwsh --version
```

## Install codemelted CLI

The `codemelted.ps1` CLI script is hosted at [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/codemelted/0.5.3) to facilitate its installation as discussed below.

### cmdlets

- `Find-Script -Name codemelted`: To find the current version published in the PSGallery.
- `Install-Script -Name codemelted`: To install the codemelted CLI from the PSGallery.
- `Update-Script -Name codemelted`: To update to the latest version of the codemelted CLI from the PSGallery.
- `Uninstall-Script -Name codemelted`: To completely uninstall the codemelted CLI.

### Troubleshooting

#### Linux / Mac / Raspberry Pi

On the various supported unix variant operating systems, the `$env:PSModulePath` does not include the `Scripts/` path where the `Install-Script` installs the `codemelted.ps1` script file. To fix this issue, add the following entry to the appropriate **Sources** script so when you kick off `pwsh` shell, you can access the `codemelted` command.

**Sources:** The following bullets discuss the script profile order from login to executing an interactive shell. Utilize this to determine where to put the script code below to add the pwsh scripts to the `$PATH` variable.

- [Shell Startup](https://docs.nersc.gov/environment/shell_startup/)
- [zsh Guide Section 2.2](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Guide/zshguide02.html)

**Shell Code to Add to Appropriate Login / Startup Script:**

```sh
# set PATH so it includes user's pwsh installed scripts
if [ -d "$HOME/.local/share/powershell/Scripts" ]; then
   PATH="$HOME/.local/share/powershell/Scripts:$PATH"
fi
```

#### Windows OS

No issues when running the `Install-Script` cmdlet on Windows 10/11.


*NOTE: If the `$env:PSModulePath` is not a part of the `%PATH%`, you can correct this by adding the value of `$env:PSModulePath` to the [How to Edit Environment Variables on Windows 10 or 11](https://www.howtogeek.com/787217/how-to-edit-environment-variables-on-windows-10-or-11/)*

# FEATURES

<center><img style="width: 100%; max-width: 560px;" src="../../design-notes/use-case-model.drawio.png" /></center>

The following describes how the *codemelted* CLI implements the above use cases.

## codemelted.ps1 Structure

The `codemelted.ps1` is divided into three sections. The first section is the *TERMINAL MODULE DEFINITION*. This section contains the `PSScriptInfo` that describes the script on [PowerShell  Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/). It also defines the general script interface, the `--version` flag, and the `--help` system.

The next section is the *USE CASE DEFINITIONS*. This section is divided into the five use case groups reflected in the use case model above. Each of these sections contains a `function codemelted_xxx {}` definition representing each individual use case function for the given group. The function definition is divided into the `<#.SYNOPSIS #>` that defines the help section along with the `param()` which defines the interface to the function. Any violation of the function will result in a `SyntaxError: xxx` which will aid in properly using the function.

The last section is the *MAIN API DEFINITION*. This defines the mapping between the `--use-case` flag to the function call. This completes the overall `codemelted --use-case @{}` CLI signature of this module. The next sections will walk you through utilizing CLI to get help on individual use cases *(NOTE: They are also covered in this page)*.

## codemelted --version

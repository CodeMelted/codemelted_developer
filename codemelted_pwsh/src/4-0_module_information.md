## 4.2 Versioning

The versioning of the `codemelted` CLI will utilize a modified semantic versioning `X.Y.Z` with the following rules for the numbering scheme.

- **X:** Year of release. Each new year resets the `Y.Z` values to `1`
- **Y:** Breaking change to one of the use case functions or upgrade of dependencies requiring considerations within an app. A change in this value resets `.Z` to `1`.
- **Z:** Bug fix, new use case function implemented, or expansion of a use case function. Continuously updated by adding one with each new release unless reset by `X.Y` changes.

TITLE: CodeMelted DEV | js Module
PUBLISH_DATE: 2025-04-06
AUTHOR: Mark Shaffer
KEYWORDS: CodeMeltedDEV, raspberry-pi, modules, cross-platform, gps, html-css-javascript, flutter-apps, pwsh, pwsh-lib, js-module, flutter-library, deno-module, pwsh-scripts, pwsh-module, rust, rust-lib
DESCRIPTION: The codemelted.rs module will be an installable crate that provides the full native speed of a C/C++ application but with modern language constructs and memory safety. While C/C++ still have their place in application development, memory safety proves to be the #1 attack vector of hackers. Rust was designed to address those shortcomings and is an ideal choice for new developers.

<h1><img style="height: 35px;" src="https://codemelted.com/assets/images/icon-js.png" /> CodeMelted DEV | js Module</h1>

The codemelted.js module will be an ES6 module that supports its usage within Deno / NodeJS V8 runtimes for backend services along with Web browsers to support regular HTML / CSS / JS Single Page Application (SPA) development. The module will make heavy usage of JSDoc typing to ensure it works with available TypeScript type checkers within a software engineers chosen development platform. This module serves as the one that can provide a singular language for the full stack solution. The others provide enhancements where this may not be applicable.

### Logger

```dart
// First initialize the logger in your main()
CLogger.init();

// Then set a log level you care about.
CLogger.logLevel = CLogger.info;

// Setup post processing of log events if necessary
CLogger.onLoggedEvent = (CLogRecord r) {
  // Handle the log event
};

// Now log events either via logger
CLogger.log(
  level: CLogger.error,
  data: "It blew up",
  st: StackTrace.current,
);

CLogger.log(
  level: CLogger.info,
  data: "It worked",

# GETTING STARTED

## Install pwsh Core

The following section walk you through the installation of the pwsh terminal. Once installed you can access the terminal via the `pwsh` command.

### Mac OS

From a Mac OS terminal execute the command:

```
brew install --cask powershell
```

### Linux OS

Follow the <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-linux?view=powershell-7.4">Install Powershell on Linux</a> to properly setup the pwsh terminal for your Linux flavor.

### Windows

From a windows cmd terminal execute the command

```
winget install --id Microsoft.PowerShell --source winget
```

### Raspberry Pi

The following series of commands will setup a pwsh terminal on a Raspberry Pi picking up the necessary repo and setting up the environment. Notice the `v7.4.6` as the currently identified version. Change this to install the latest version.

```
dpkg --add-architecture arm64
apt-get update
apt-get install -y libc6:arm64 libstdc++6:arm64
mkdir -p /opt/microsoft/powershell/7
wget -O /tmp/powershell.tar.gz https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/download/v7.4.6/powershell-7.4.6-linux-arm64.tar.gz
tar zxf /tmp/powershell.tar.gz -C /opt/microsoft/powershell/7
chmod +x /opt/microsoft/powershell/7/pwsh
ln -s /opt/microsoft/powershell/7/pwsh /usr/bin/pwsh
rm /tmp/powershell.tar.gz
pwsh --version
```

## Install codemelted CLI

### Find-Script

To find the current version published in the PSGallery execute:

```
Find-Script -Name codemelted
```

### Install-Script

To install the codemelted CLI from the PS Gallery execute:

```
Install-Script -Name codemelted
```

### Update-Script

To update to the latest version of the codemelted CLI from the PS Gallery execute:

```
Update-Script -Name codemelted
```

#### Uninstall-Script

To completely uninstall the codemelted CLI execute:

```
Uninstall-Script -Name codemelted
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Mac OS

On Mac OS in the zsh terminal, the `$env:PSModulePath` does not include the `Scripts/` path where the `Install-Script` installs the `codemelted.ps1` script file. To fix this issue, add the following entry to your `.zshrc` file.

```bash
export PWSH_SCRIPT_INSTALL="$HOME/.local/share/powershell/Scripts:/usr/local/share/powershell/Scripts:/usr/local/microsoft/powershell/7/Scripts"
# Make sure on this to not eliminate any other script settings.
export PATH="$PWSH_SCRIPT_INSTALL:$PATH"
```

#### Windows OS

No issues when running the `Install-Script` cmdlet.

# USAGE

## codemelted CLI

The following sub-sections break down how to drill into the codemelted CLI help system. It utilizes the PowerShell Help system tailored to the codemelted CLI needs.

### Get Version

`codemelted --about` will tell you what version of the codemelted CLI module is installed. The output will be as follows:

```
Name       Version Author                      Description
----       ------- ------                      -----------
codemelted 0.1.0.0 mark.shaffer@codemelted.com   A CLI to facilitate common developer use cases on Mac, Linux, or Windows systems.
```

To check for the latest version of the script execute `Update-Script -Name codemelted` in a `pwsh` terminal window.

### Navigate Help

`codemelted --help` will produce the following STDOUT from the PowerShell `Get-Help` system. From the help output, you can drill into the help system of each `[Action]`. You only care about the following fields from any command help:

- SYNOPSIS

KEYWORDS: CodeMeltedDeveloper, raspberry-pi, modules, cross-platform, gps, html-css-javascript, flutter-apps, pwsh, js-module, flutter-library, deno-module, pwsh-scripts, pwsh-module, c-library, cpp-lib
DESCRIPTION: All programming happens synchronously (i.e. one instruction to the next). This occurs within the event loop of the main SDK execution thread. This use case will provide the ability for chunking up this work. The developer will be able to schedule one off tasks awaiting the result via a promise. They will have the ability to schedule repeating tasks. They will have the ability to communicate with other services via a process. Lastly they will have the ability to queue tasks for processing via a worker pool.

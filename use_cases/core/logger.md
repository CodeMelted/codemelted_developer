### Set Log Level

**Description:** The logger will operating with four logging levels and the ability to turn off the logging facility. This use case facilitates setting the log level to act upon within the module.

**Actors:** The application utilizing the codemelted module.

**Pre-Condition:** The logger has been properly initialized with the application.

**Post-Condition:** Log level is set for the logging facility.

**Scenario:**

1. If desired, log level is set to *debug*.
2. If desired, log level is set to *info*.
3. If desired, log level is set to *warning*.
4. If desired, log level is set to *error*.
5. If desired, log level is set to *off*.
6. END.

**Exceptions:**

None.

### On Log Event

**Description:** Standard logging will report via STDOUT to allow for quick debugging of an application and validating app reporting. Post processing of the log record allows for an app to post the log records either to a local file or a database for later analysis and troubleshooting.

**Actors:** The application utilizing the codemelted module.

**Pre-Condition:** The logger has been properly initialized with the application.

**Post-Condition:** The log record is post processed.

**Scenario:**

1. If post processing is enabled, receive the log event and process it.
2. END.

**Exceptions:**

None.

### Log Event

**Description:** A logged event will be reported via STDOUT. This will allow a developer to troubleshoot their app during development. Once their app is ready for production, post processing will be the ideal for capturing logged data along with setting an appropriate log level of events.

**Actors:** The application utilizing the codemelted module.

**Pre-Condition:** The logger has been properly initialized with the application.

**Post-Condition:**

1. The logged event is reported to STDOUT formatted as follows when a stack trace is specified:

    ```
    2024-04-25T21:17:33.816297 [SEVERE] CodeMelted-Logger: error
    #0      main.<anonymous closure>.<anonymous closure> (file:///C:/Users/DarkT/Documents/GitHub/codemelted_developer/modules/codemelted_flutter/test/codemelted_flutter_test.dart:91:46)
    #1      Declarer.test.<anonymous closure>.<anonymous closure> (package:test_api/src/backend/declarer.dart:215:19)
    <asynchronous suspension>
    #2      Declarer.test.<anonymous closure> (package:test_api/src/backend/declarer.dart:213:7)
    <asynchronous suspension>
    #3      Invoker._waitForOutstandingCallbacks.<anonymous closure> (package:test_api/src/backend/invoker.dart:258:9)
    <asynchronous suspension>
    ```
2. The logged event is reported to STDOUT formatted as follows without a stacktrace specified:

    ```
    2024-04-25T21:17:33.816297 [INFO] CodeMelted-Logger: info
    ```

3. The logged event is not reported to STDOUT due to log level setting. Meaning if the log level is set *error*, then *debug*, *info*, and *warning* events will be ignored.

**Scenario:**

1. Logger is called specifying the log level of the event, the data associated with the event, and if necessary, a stack trace.
2. [Set Log Level](#set-log-level) checks the event log level against the currently set log level to determine whether the event is reported to STDOUT.
3. [On Log Event](#on-log-event) further processes the event if it is set and the event was processed in step 2.
4. END.

**Exceptions:**

*Step 1a: Logger was not initialized.*

1. assert is thrown and developer must correct their code.
2. Proceed to step 4.

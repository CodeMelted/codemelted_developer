TITLE: CodeMelted Developer | Data Use Case
PUBLISH_DATE: 2024-11-28
AUTHOR: Mark Shaffer
KEYWORDS: CodeMeltedDeveloper, raspberry-pi, modules, cross-platform, gps, html-css-javascript, flutter-apps, pwsh, js-module, flutter-library, deno-module, pwsh-scripts, pwsh-module, c-library, cpp-lib
DESCRIPTION: The number one reason developers write code is to take data in as input, process it, and then spit that data as output. Going along with this philosophy, this use case will provide a developer the ability read, write, and process data. The input / output mechanisms will be via files, embedded database, and storage facilities for holding key / value pairs of data. Given the dynamic nature of data, a series of type checks will be provided to the developer. Lastly JSON represents the most versatile data type that works between languages. The developer will have access to work with this data type with encoding / decoding capabilities between the JSON object and string formats.

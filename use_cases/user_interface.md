DESCRIPTION: The biggest thing all applications have is a way of interacting with a user. This use case will expose a common way for either building a Command Line Interface (CLI) prompting the user for input or building a complex Single Page App (SPA) interface. This will allow for a consistent experience of communicating with an application user.
